Contributing
============

Do you want to help with the development of yupi? We have some ideas on how to do it:


Bug reporting
-------------

Your script isn't working, and you are sure the issue lies with yupi? Make sure you are using the latest available pypi package and if the problem persists, open an issue in `GitHub <https://github.com/yupidevs/yupi/issues>`_ to let us know.


Requesting new features
-----------------------

You can use the options provided in :ref:`Getting Support` to suggest new features you want to see in new releases of yupi.


Extending yupi source code
--------------------------

If you want to contribute directly to the project (improve documentation, implement new features or fix existing bugs) you can make a pull request and we will analyze it as soon as possible.


Adding new examples of usage
----------------------------

Even without contributing to the yupi source code, if you develop an application based on yupi, you can request its addition to the dedicated repository of yupi examples hosted in `this GitHub repository <https://github.com/yupidevs/yupi_examples/stargazers>`_.


Increasing yupi visibility
--------------------------

To help us reach a broader audience in the scientific community, you can help us by:

 * Star the project `yupi <https://github.com/yupidevs/yupi/stargazers>`_ in GitHub
 * Star the project `yupi_examples <https://github.com/yupidevs/yupi_examples/stargazers>`_ in GitHub
 * Cite our `arxiv paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06340>`_
