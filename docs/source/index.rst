Welcome to yupi's documentation!
================================

Standing for Yet Underused Path Instruments, **yupi** is a set of tools designed for collecting, generating and processing trajectory data. With **yupi** you can handle trajectory data in many different ways. You can generate artificial trajectories from stochastic models, capture the trajectory of an object in a sequence of images, apply transformations to the trajectories such as filtering and resampling or explore different visualizations and statistical properties of a trajectory (or collection of them). Each of the aforementioned functionalities is contained in its own submodule as shown:
